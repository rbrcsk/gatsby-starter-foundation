## Issues

There are a few minor issues:

- [`gatsby-plugin-typegen`](https://github.com/cometkim/gatsby-plugin-typegen/issues/97) fails to generate some types when in develop mode
  the gatsby version is pinned to a working one
- [`gatsby-plugin-typegen`](https://github.com/cometkim/gatsby-plugin-typegen/issues/48) can't export the query from the gatsby config
  As a workaround a dummy component was added
- There's no IDE typehinting in the gatsby node file
